# AskMyDoc

AskMyDoc is an AI-powered application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions based on the content of those documents. It uses a combination of frontend technologies (React, Axios and TailwindCSS) and backend technologies (Node.js, Express.js, Langchain, Google Vertex AI, pdfreader, and multer) to provide this functionality.

**Note:** Sending frequent questions might exceed requests quota please take care of that.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Axios
- **Backend**: node.js, express.js, @langchain, @langchain/google-vertexai, pdfreader, multer

## Local Setup Guide

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the `client/ui` directory from root and install the frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd client/ui
npm install
```

### 3. Install Backend Dependencies
Move to the `server` directory from and install the backend dependencies:

If you are in  `ui` directory right now:
```
cd ../../server
npm install
```
If you are at root:
```
cd server
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
#### Frontend

In the `client/ui` directory, create a `.env` file and add the following environment variable:

```
VITE_BACKEND_API = "your-backend-api-link"
```

#### Backend
In the server directory, create a JSON file containing your Google project credentials. Name it `credentials.json` or any name of your choice.

Create a `.env` file in the server directory and add the following environment variable, specifying the path to your Google project credentials:

```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "path-to-your-google-project-credentials.json-file"
```

In my example:
```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS= "./credentials.json"
```

### 5. Running the Application
#### Frontend

To run the frontend application, navigate to the `client/ui` directory and execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the frontend application at http://localhost:5173/.

#### Backend
To run the backend server, navigate to the `server` directory and execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```
The server will run by default at http://localhost:4000/. If you want to use a different port, set the `PORT` environment variable in your `.env` file or change the hardcoded port value in the `index.js` file.

### 6. Creating the Uploads Directory
You might need to create an `uploads` directory in the `server` directory to store uploaded files. Create it manually if it's not created automatically on starting server, you can also run the following command in `server` directory:

```bash
mkdir uploads
```
This should allow you to run your application locally.
